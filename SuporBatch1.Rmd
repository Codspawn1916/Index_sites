Part 2: May __, 2023

Today I am just going to randomize what I have so far so that students can extract in a random order, even though we do not yet have the extraction barcodes nor a very large batch.


```{r}
batch1Sup <- read.csv("Supor Batch 1.csv") #upload supor list file, I changed this to the new filename but left the rest

batch1sup_vector <- batch1Sup$Supor.Batch.1 #pull list into vector
batch1sup_vector #look at it 

set.seed(2)     # Set seed
batch1sup_vector_rand <- sample(batch1sup_vector)        # randomize vector
batch1sup_vector_rand  # Print shuffled vector


batch1sup_rand <- as.data.frame(batch1sup_vector_rand) #turn vector into a table again

write.csv(batch1sup_rand, file = "Batch1sup_randomized.csv") #save table as CSV
```
